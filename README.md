# Drift Coding Challenge

## Joke Bot Service

1. Fork this repository (this will be where you show your work)
2. Create a Drift account here: https://app.drift.com/letsgo
3. Once you've signed up, register an app using these instructions: https://devdocs.drift.com/docs/quick-start.
4. Create a "joke bot service" that when installed, looks for the phrase `Tell me a joke`, and successfully returns a random joke to the chat (APIs below).
5. Connect your service to your Drift account and test it via your drift.me profile page (make your profile public here: https://app.drift.com/settings/profile)
6. Send your results to `pete@drift.com` and `keith@drift.com`

Use one of the following APIs for your joke service:
